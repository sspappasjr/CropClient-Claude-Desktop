quick update to the page factory

the cropclient live chat is the master with injector marks
  not much in the area of css

chat s1 thru s4 and script are the names of components to be added
the chat 2x2 is our most visual working template but the 
  the markers are not there yet and 
 and top the left and right are swaps ( a mistake )

pagebuilder skills is the most recent builder it does the work
 you select your components for each type and hit inject all 
 and you have an app not much more to add to get it working 

Steve P go for it
