GitHub Butler - How To Use
==========================
Version: v1.0
Date: February 15, 2026

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Butler lets you browse and manage your GitHub repos from a single HTML page.
No installs. No command line. Just open in a browser.

SETUP (ONE TIME)
----------------
1. Go to github.com
2. Click your profile pic (top right) > Settings
3. Scroll to very bottom of left sidebar > Developer settings
4. Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
5. Generate new token (classic)
6. Name: "Butler"
7. Check the "repo" box (full control of private repositories)
8. Click "Generate token"
9. COPY THE TOKEN - it starts with ghp_ and you only see it once
10. Save it somewhere safe (notepad, password manager, etc.)

HOW TO USE
----------
1. Open CropClient-Github-Butler.html in your browser
2. Click "Login" button (top right)
3. Paste your token when prompted
4. Your repos appear in the dropdown

FEATURES (v1.0)
---------------
- Login/Logout     : Enter your GitHub token, stays for the browser session
- Repo Dropdown    : Lists all your repos, sorted by recently updated
- Browse Files     : Click a repo to see its files and folders
- Navigate Folders : Click folders to go in, click ".." to go back up
- View Files       : Click any file to see its contents
- Create Repo      : Click "+ Create New Repo" to make a new repo on GitHub
- Refresh          : Reload your repo list

BUTTONS AT BOTTOM
-----------------
- Pull / Push / Sync : These are local git operations.
  Butler is a browser app so it can't run git commands on your machine.
  Use Claude Code or your terminal for these.

SECURITY
--------
- Your token is stored in sessionStorage (browser tab memory only)
- Close the tab = token is gone
- Token is NEVER saved to disk or sent anywhere except github.com
- Never share your token with anyone
